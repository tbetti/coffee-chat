  ## Description
  This application allows users to create an account and chat instantly with other logged-in users.  It encourages people to get to know each other better and socialize, especially during the pandemic when they have little face-time together.  It is deployed at the following [Heroku site](https://birds-of-a-feather-chat.herokuapp.com/)

  ## Installation
  Download all files and open in your source code editor.  In a terminal, connect to mysql and run “source db/schema.sql” to create the database.  In another terminal, run npm install to ensure all the necessary packages are installed.   Next run “node models/index.js” to create models or tables of the data, and then run “npm run seed” to fill the models with data.  Once all this is complete, run “npm start” to start the application at server 3001.

  ## Usage
  Once at either the [Heroku site](https://birds-of-a-feather-chat.herokuapp.com/) or running on your local host, register as a new user by providing your name, email, and a password.  If you have already registered, you need only your email and password to log back in.  After logging in or registering, you will be directed to a chat room.  You will be able to see other users who are also logged in to the site.  Send instant messages to each other by typing in the chat box at the bottom of the page, then hit the “send” button.  All messages will display on the right side of the page.  To logout, hit the “Log Out” button on the top left of the webpage.
